TODO: add screenshot of landing page and compodoc

### Overview üîñ

Explore the world of Angular and NgRx with **Code quest**, a single-page application (SPA) that showcases key features in frontend development.

### Features üéÅ

User is available to run application, then:

- visit page with books
  - perform search for book's name
  - add/remove book to favorite books
- visit page with favorite books
  - remove book from favorite books

> IMPORTANT
>
> Out of demo purpose, all functionality related to favorite books is stored locally in the browser.
> Please note that page refresh or server restart will cause DATA LOSS of all favorite books.

#### Technical details

- **complete UI styling with responsiveness** (mobile and desktop, starting with mobile first), having good UX in mind
- **modules** (books, shared and design system) with lazy loading
- **layout** (header with navigation, footer and main)
- **components** (breadcrumbs, pagination, generic error, book, book list and book detail)
- **routing with page components**
  - /
  - /books
  - /books/detail/:id
  - /books/favorite
  - /design-system
- **services** (books and favorite books)
- **store** (using actions, effects, reducers and selectors for books and favorite books)
- **pipes** (divider and numeric list)
- **icons with lazy loading**
- **mocks** (used at design system page and unit tests)
- **utility functions**
- **generated documentation** of application parts

All components are prefixed with `cq` (i.e. code quest), e.g. **cq-breadcrumbs** to potentially avoid conflicts with other libraries.
